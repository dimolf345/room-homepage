## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- CSS Grid
- SASS
- Javascript

### What I learned

Use this section to recap over some of your major learnings while working through this project. Writing these out and providing code samples of areas you want to highlight is a great way to reinforce your own knowledge.

To see how you can add code snippets, see below:

```html
<h1>Some HTML code I'm proud of</h1>
```

<ul>
  <li>Using for first time CSS Grid</li>
  <li>Using for first time SASS with modularity logic</li>
  <li>Creating by my hand a simple slider with JS</li>
</ul>

### Continued development

For the next project I want to practice with API data fetching and JS. More over, I will try to be more readable in writing my code, for example by writing HTML and CSS using BEM logic.
