## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- CSS Grid
- SASS
- Javascript

### What I learned

It seemed an easy project at first, but then I realized that the best way to achieve the challenge was to use CSS Grid, which I didn't know.
So I decided to study is watching the tutorial from Wes Bos and reading the "Definitive CSS Guide" from CSS tricks.
I learned also how to choose the perfect img source depending on display size with the srcset attribute.
And lastly, I coded a simple but effective slider with Javascript.

I know this project it's far from perfect, but I put a lot of effort on It and I'm really proud of it, in particular for:

<ul>
  <li>Using for first time CSS Grid</li>
  <li>Using for first time SASS with modularity logic</li>
  <li>Creating by my hand a simple slider with JS</li>
</ul>

### Continued development

For the next project I want to practice with API data fetching and JS. More over, I will try to be more readable in writing my code, for example by writing HTML and CSS using BEM logic.
